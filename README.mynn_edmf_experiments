*******************
Experiments:

  c96L33_am4p0-mynn_edmf_field_table
      - standard AM4 with one change: Using field_table_am4p11_edmf_mynn, because some variables in MYNN-EDMF are semi-prognostic.
      - the results are idential to standard AM4.

  c96L33_am4p0-mynnED
      - AM4 with MYNN ED scheme. 
      - MYNN ED is put in physics_down where the PBL scheme is called.
      - Because the shallow plume needs PBL depth, here the PBL depth is diagnosed as the same way as Lock does, not from MYNN-EDMF.

  c96L33_am4p0-mynn_edmf_EDonly
      - AM4 with the MYNN-EDMF framework, but only ED is on. AM4 shallow plume is still on.
      - MYNN-EDMF is in physics_up.
      - This aims to test the MYNN-EDMF machinery.
      - The results are similar to c96L33_am4p0-mynnED

  c96L33_am4p0-mynn_edmf_EDMF
      - AM4 with the full MYNN-EDMF.
      - AM4 shallow plume is turn off, because the MF can do shallow convection.
